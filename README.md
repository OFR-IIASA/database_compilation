# Creating a database for raw data (with a little processing)

## Overview
This repository provides scripts to create a PostgreSQL database for the following data:
	1.
	2.
	3.
	4.

## PostgreSQL database installation and configuration

In order to run the scripts, you will first need to install PostgreSQL. This can be obtained from:
<https://www.postgresql.org/download/>

During the installation process, please note the user, password and port as these will need to be added to a config file,
so that they can connect to the database.  Please copy the template "config_template.yaml" and rename this to "config.yaml".

**NOTE: The "config.yaml" file is and should not be added to the repository.**

## Documentation

Documentation, when available from the data-host, can be found in the /raw_data_documentation folder.
